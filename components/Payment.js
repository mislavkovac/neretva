										Check the shipping address: never send your package to an

									</li>
									<li>
										Track your package: always use a shipping service that
										includes an online tracking system and Proof of Delivery, as
										you can reassure your worried customers by providing a
										tracking number.
									</li>
									<li>
										Keep your customers informed: if there are unforeseen
										delivery delays, remember to tell your customers.

									<li>
										Identify high-risk behavior: multiple orders to the same
										address in a short space of time, orders for high-risk
										countries, etc. In case of doubt, do not hesitate to call
										your customer to check the contact information and the
										identity of the credit card holder. If you think it is a
